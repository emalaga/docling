      "The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence is transforming the music industry. As a technology, it is increasingly becoming a mainstay in the creation and marketing of music. This white paper is intended to shed light on the various ways in which generative AI is impacting the music industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Viewed historically, the music industry has always been shaped by technological progress, be it the introduction of vinyl records, synthesisers or digital music production. But the most recent innovation in this field - generative AI - marks a paradigm shift. Not only does it enable new forms of music production, it also brings fundamental changes to the ways in which music is shared, marketed and experienced. It comes with unimagined opportunities for creativity and personalisation and at the same time points to complex issues in the areas of copyright, authenticity and artistic integrity. As this technology continues to develop, we will be faced with the challenge of harnessing its potential while simultaneously approaching its implications in a responsible manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Aim and structure of the white paper\n",
      "\n",
      "This white paper seeks to present the material connections between generative AI and the music industry in a comprehensible form. From discussing specific fields of application to elaborating on legal and ethical issues, this document provides a comprehensive resource to anyone interested in exploring the points of intersection between AI and music (business).\n",

      "Chapter 2 (Definitions) is intended to provide a basic understanding of core concepts within generative AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 3 outlines the impacts on four specific areas of the music industry: 3.1. AI and Music Production describes how current models for music generation work, groups them into a new system and highlights the opportunities and limitations of these programs. 3.2. AI among Music Labels indicates areas in which the technology can be used to market music, including content creation, marketing itself and process optimisation. 3.3 AI among Music Publishers explains the significance of metadata in connection with AI and raises the question of future licensing models. 3.4 AI in the Live Segment highlights initial approaches to the use of generative AI in the live industry, such as for bookings or in live performances.\n",

      "## Artificial intelligence\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field within computer science that deals with the creation of systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These systems are designed to solve complex problems, make decisions and even develop creative potential by replicating human cognitive processes such as learning, deducing and perceiving. Among the AI technologies are, for example, machine learning (ML), neural networks, natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. These technologies enable machines to learn from experience, detect patterns and reach decisions with a certain degree of autonomy. 1\n",

      "## Generative artificial intelligence\n",
      "\n",
      "A hallmark of this area of AI is the autonomous ability to generate fresh content that is barely distinct from creative human output. In this regard, the term 'generative' refers to the autonomous capacity of AI systems to create works, including texts, images, code or music. 2\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI technology builds on a combined foundation of advanced machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks. These systems are designed to analyse and process large volumes of data and, on this basis, to identify and replicate patterns, structures and complex relationships. At the heart of this process is deep learning, which is enabled by multilayer neural networks. Each layer in these networks is specialised in the extraction and processing of certain attributes in the input data - including texts, sounds and images. A huge variety of data is used to train these networks, which then learn to detect and replicate specific aspects, enabling them to emulate human creativity in the form of speech, music or visual arts. It is this capability to detect and replicate patterns that sets generative AI apart and taps into a wide range of potential applications. 3\n",

      "\n",
      "Recent years have seen significant progress in the development of AI models for music generation. 4 Initially, it was only possible to generate individual components of  compositions  automatically  (e.g.  melody,  rhythm),  or  only  music  within  certain genres. 5 Since then, however, some models have acquired the capability to create longer pieces of lyric-based music that consumers find difficult to distinguish from those composed by humans. What is more, there are numerous AI applications that can be used for individual stages within professional music production. 6 The deep controversy underlying this trend is reflected in the fact that 73% of copyright holders surveyed in a study by the collecting societies GEMA and SACEM believe that their livelihoods are at risk. 7\n",

      "A uniform system to categorise the wide variety of AI music tools has not yet been established to  date.  Some  differ  according to the target  audience  (from  consumers  to  professional  users), 8 and  others  depending  on  the field in which they are used (e.g. for songwriting or mastering). 9\n",
      "\n",
      "A system that categorises all current tools based on their interactivity and output quality might provide a potential solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here,  interactivity  is  defined  as the  degree  to  which  musical  output  can  be influenced by a person, that is, an artist. This might include, for example, extensive options for text prompts in audio generation. Another hallmark  of  interactivity  among  tools  is  their suitability  for  use  in  a  reciprocal  co-creative process,  for  example  by  suggesting  new compositions based on a person's own compositions or by automating a particular area of music production.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quality  describes  the  quality  of output  and  can  be  subdivided  into  musical quality  and  production  quality.  High-quality music will possess a coherent structure with clear transitions, themes and motifs. It should be  meaningful  from  a  musical  perspective and adhere to fundamental tenets of rhythm, harmony and melody. Production  quality  describes balance in the sound and audio quality.\n",

      "The three basic areas of 3.1.1 Experimental Models/Research, 3.1.2 AI-powered Plugins for Music Professionals and 3.1.3 Creator/Consumer Tools - which are described on the following pages - can be distinguished along these axes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.1.1 Experimental Models/ Research\n",
      "\n",
      "This area includes models that are developed in research on AI-generated music and are publicly usable. The code is accessible, and there are research reports describing how the models are trained and evaluated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current applications such as MusicGen 10 or MusicLM 11 , which are developed by research groups supported Meta or Google, are highly interactive: text input is used to generate music as an audio waveform. Some of the codes and libraries can be used, customised and trained with the user's own data. Although the audio quality of these models is improving steadily, some noise disturbance or artefacts may occur nonetheless. More extended passages are often substandard as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The models should be perceived as a foundation for building more advanced applications. But with the usual transparency of training data, detailed descriptions of the model architectures and the publicly accessible code, they do promote progress in academia and commercial projects alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.1.2 AI-powered Plug-ins\n",
      "\n",
      "Ambitious hobby musicians and professional artists can all draw on artificial intelligence to assist with many areas of the music production process. Music producers can use tools that take complete or partial control of mixing and mastering, and make suggestions  for  melodies,  chord  structures  or  suitable  loops  and  samples. These plug-ins generate output (such as sounds, MIDI notes) that is highly variable and suitable for professional processing. Provided the instruments are used correctly, the quality of musical output is potentially excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important fields of application are:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Songwriting\n",
      "\n",
      "AI supports the creation of unique melodies and chord progressions in the area of songwriting, presenting artists with fresh creative perspectives and inspiration for their musical works. Used meaningfully, these tools can establish a co-creative process between the artist and AI. Aside from the actual work on individual melodies or text components, the tools are also able to generate complete musical pieces as inspiration in the songwriting process - for instance to review how a text might work in a variety of keys and with different instrumental arrangements.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Mixing &amp; mastering\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of AI in the mixing and mastering process automatically adjusts levels, optimises EQ settings and improves sound quality. This can create a more efficient and consistent audio production - at least for users who are keen to save time and costs\n",

      "\n",
      "otherwise expended on human mixing/mastering and who view the specific sound produced by a human expert in mixing or mastering as less important.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Voice cloning/synthesis\n",
      "\n",
      "Technologies used to clone and synthesise voices can be used to generate realistic, adaptable digital voices that are, in many cases, barely distinguishable from human speech. They can be used for deep fakes, among other things, and first attracted a lot of attention in the wake of the viral song Heart on my Sleeve with voices replicating those of Drake &amp; The Weeknd. 12 By contrast, there are start-ups that legally licence artists' voices, which can then be used for demo versions, toplines or in other areas. 13\n",
      "\n",
      "## Stem separation\n",
      "\n",
      "AI  simplifies  the  separation  of  individual  components  (stems)  from  mixed  audio  tracks.  This  may  include  isolating  vocals  from  instruments,  which  adds flexibility  to  the  editing  and  remixing  processes.  Examples  in  which  this  technology  has  been  used  include  the  Beatles  song  Now  and  Then,  for  which the  voice  of  John  Lennon  was  extracted  from  an  old  cassette  recording. 14 This kind of separation into individual tracks is also very helpful for DJs to create creative mixes, for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Sounds &amp; samples\n",
      "\n",
      "AI applications analyse audio attributes and the preferences that users express for particular pieces of music to improve the process of searching for sounds and samples. They use this information to suggest suitable sounds and samples for musical projects. In recent months, services have been added to this segment that draw on prompts to generate individual sounds or entire sample packs. This may potentially offer a meaningful alternative to the search for suitable samples in libraries, as the samples generated can be tailored to the specific context of the music production.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from the use cases listed here, an increase in the number of services that combine a selection of functionalities has also been noted. They may, for example, offer models for audio separation, voice generation and AI mastering in a single tool suite.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3.1.3 Creator/Consumer Tools\n",
      "\n",
      "This segment comprises applications for the generation of functional music, initial musical ideas or complete songs based on prompt input. Functional music means pieces that are composed or selected for a specific purpose, including for commercials  or  as  background music. While the audio quality produced by these models was initially appealing, the interactive options for creative development were largely limited. But rapid progress in this area - due in particular to the possibility of generating lyrics and vocals - has increasingly given these models the status of perceived competitors to human-composed music, especially in the streaming market.\n",

      "## AI music with vocals\n",
      "\n",
      "Two models - Suno and Udio - have been introduced to the market in recent months, fuelling controversy in the discussion about AI-generated music models. These models are the first of their kind to enable the generation of complete tracks, including vocals, in various languages and genres, based entirely on prompts. They mean that people will no longer require prior knowledge of music to create (comparatively) professional sounding songs quickly and easily. And although the quality of the models varies depending on the prompt and the genre, the models are highly interactive. Users can manipulate the texts/vocals and instrumental arrangements as separate components and even add their own lyrics. Adding to this since June 2024 has been the ability for users to upload and continue working on their own pieces of music or audio recordings.\n",
      "\n",
      "These providers have been criticised for a lack of transparency with regard to their training data, as the compositions generated in this way are viewed by the public as high quality. Given that the output produced by these models (including voices or individual melody lines) sometimes bears similarities to well-known songs, the providers have been accused of using protected material for training purposes. 15 16\n",

      "Chapter 4 contains a more detailed exploration of legal and ethical relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Royalty-free (background) music\n",
      "\n",
      "This area covers background music for content creators or companies. Short, personalised pieces or loops can be generated as an alternative to compositions from production music libraries. The  majority  of  models  do  not  synthesise  sound  artificially and instead allow users to select genres, moods, instruments or tempo. This selection influences a structure of loops or MIDI notes preconfigured in the services, which are combined once again to create unique pieces of music. Therefore, these applications can produce output that sounds monotonous, and the scope for downstream interaction is low. But there are models in this segment that operate on the basis of text prompts and are hence more interactive.\n",
      "\n",
      "## DIY production tools\n",
      "\n",
      "The tools in this area work in a similar way to the services described earlier. However, they also provide additional functions such as the option to export MIDI notes or edit them directly in a structure comprising a piano roll and a simple sequencer.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Functional generative models\n",
      "\n",
      "Another segment contains applications for functional music, e.g. to improve relaxation or concentration. Companies such as Endel and Lifescore also collaborate with artists  to  create  continuous  'soundscapes'  from  their  works. These  services  tend to offer users only limited interactivity. But the music generated does respond and adapt to metrics such as the weather, time of day or, if selected, the user's heart rate.\n",

      "YouTube is taking an active role at the intersection of artificial intelligence and music and has announced a series of projects and experiments that demonstrate YouTube's approach to integrating AI into the music industry. They are working closely with artists and the music industry to develop innovative and secure solutions that enrich the creative process while ensuring the protection and integrity of artists' works.\n",

      "The  'Music AI  Incubator'  was  launched  by YouTube  in  2023  and  now includes dozens of global artists, songwriters and producers. Participants include Anitta, Björn Ulvaeus, d4vd, Don Was, Juanes, Louis Bell, Max Richter, Rodney Jerkins, Rosanne Cash, Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic, Yo Gotti, the estate of Frank Sinatra, Wyclef Jean and many others who provide insights into YouTube's generative AI experiments and research to help shape and test new creative tools. 19 Together Google DeepMind and YouTube are exploring a 'Music AI Sandbox': These tools are intended to support the creative process by, for example, enabling you to sing a melody to create a trumpet sound, transform chords from a MIDI keyboard into a realistic vocal choir. Other functions include creating accompanying instrumental tracks to existing vocals or transforming audio from one musical style to another. In parallel, Google DeepMind has announced 'Lyria', an advanced AI music generation model. Lyria is able to create high-quality music with instruments and vocals and offers users more control over the style and execution of the music produced. The first collaboration with major artists in this context is DreamTrack, which is a consumer and creator tool, featuring a set of AI experiments, some incorporating vocal capabilities, which has been launched in the US with nine renowned artists. 20\n",

      "Another important aspect of YouTube's AI strategy is the protection of the creative work of the artists and creators. The Content ID YouTube's technology has proven to be effective in identifying songs on the platform, giving rights holders control over revenue, and maintaining a balance between the interests of creators and the creative community on the platform. YouTube plans to continue to expand this technology to address the challenges of AI-generated content and keep the platform safe - for example, to counteract copyright infringement, misinformation, and spam. One example of this is the introduction of SynthID, a technology that adds a watermark to AI-generated audio content that is inaudible to the human ear to identify its origin and prevent abuse. 21\n",

Besides the tracking of historical use, metadata is also indispensable for sorting, categorising and locating content. In this context, generative AI can be used to analyse and deliver metadata that improves the accuracy of recommendations and makes it easier for current and new works to reach their target audience.

Initial platforms for rights management - including Musical AI (formerly SOMMS.AI) - that manage the catalogues of rights holders and grant licences to AI companies, while simultaneously recording use and reporting back to the rights holders, are becoming increasingly important in this area. 35\n",

      "\n",
      "## 4.1 Generative AI and Copyright\n",
      "\n",
      "<!-- image -->\n",
      "\n",
      "While the discussion of how AI-powered music will affect copyright is not new, it is becoming increasingly pressing as the models and their musical output become increasingly advanced, blurring the boundaries between human creativity and machine generation. 41\n",
      "\n",
      "## Legal situation\n",
      "\n",
      "To qualify for protection, the Copyright Act (UrhG) requires a 'personal intellectual creation', which demands that the author - as a human - engages in creative activity. According to prevailing legal opinion, machine outputs - generated for instance by artificial  intelligence  -  are  not  eligible  for  protection. Although technology  can  be used as a tool in the creative process, the eligibility for protection of creative output that is shaped materially by technical means - as is the case with AI - is the subject of controversial debate. The assessment will essentially hinge on whether the human contribution to the creative output is viewed as sufficient to award copyright to a person. 42\n",
      "\n",
      "The question of whether the software developers are entitled to copyrights to the works generated by this software depends heavily on the extent to which the programmers influence the end product. If the software is tasked with reaching autonomous decisions on materials aspects of the creative output, this would reduce the qualification of programmers to obtain copyright. At the same time, ancillary copyrights, particularly in the field of music, are becoming increasingly important, especially to classify the copyright status of output generated by AI programs and the input used in the process. The rights of the original authors remain in force whenever an AI program reproduces or transforms copyright-protected works. 43 There  have been consistent rulings in this regard, including when comparing between US and European case law. 44\n",

      "## Demands from associations/stakeholder groups\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of the importance of the topic and out of concern that precedents might be established, various international associations have published principles/guidelines on generative artificial intelligence (including the Human Artistry Campaign, UK Music, Independent Music Publishers International Forum).\n",
      "\n",
      "The following points feature most frequently in publications on AI guidelines and principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Permission: Permission must be obtained from rights holders if their music is used for training purposes.\n",
      "- Transparency/traceability: The issue of which works are used in the training process must be traceable.\n",
      "- Compulsory labelling: AI-generated music must be labelled as such.\n",
      "- Purely AI-generated works: Works that were created without a human creative process should not be afforded copyright protection.\n",
      "- Personal rights of the artists &amp; songwriters: They must be upheld, especially in the context of deep fakes in the area of voice generation.\n",

      "- Designing the model to prevent it from generating illegal content\n",
      "- Publishing summaries of copyrighted data used for training' 45\n",
      "\n",
      "## Response from the music industry\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent study on training datasets used in automatic music generation highlights the pressing relevance of these requirements. It revealed that almost half of all datasets contained music available online that was used without obtaining the permission from the artists. 46 The study investigated scientific models that reveal basic transparency with regard to their datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation in the commercial segment is different, which is increasingly prompting a response to this development from the music industry. Sony Music was the first to respond, sending a letter to 700 companies in the AI sector stating that their works (from both the label and publishing side) must not be used for training AI models. 47\n",
      "\n",
      "This was followed by copyright lawsuits filed by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) against Udio and Suno, currently the most prominent providers as described in section 3.1. The lawsuits relate to the allegation that both companies failed to obtain permission before using copyrighted music to train their AI models. RIAA argues that this does not constitute 'fair use' and that the generated content is in direct competition with the original works, thereby inflicting significant harm on the music industry. 48\n",

      "\n",
      "A recent study of models for music and language generation reveals only 10% mention potentially negative impacts. It follows that many developers seem barely aware of this aspect. 49  The following areas are mentioned in addition to the points listed earlier: 49 Barnett (2023)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biases\n",
      "\n",
      "Research in the field of music information retrieval primarily takes place in the USA and Europe, so many of the datasets used to train music models tend to be western. 50 This might potentially impact the output of AI music models, such as retaining the circle of fifths and the distinction between major and minor keys, even if doing so is entirely unintentional. 51  This is a fundamental problem in machine learning, where models often inherit biases from their training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Cultural appropriation\n",
      "\n",
      "By contrast, generative audio models - which can draw on extensive and diverse data sets - run the risk of cultural appropriation, especially if the data contains content from marginalised cultures. Not only does the music generated reflect the inherent biases in the training data, it might furthermore inadvertently appropriate cultural elements without properly understanding or engaging with the communities in question. 52  This highlights the need for a careful consideration of how training data is composed to avoid perpetuating biases and cultural insensitivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Fairness in training data\n",
      "\n",
      "The example of music recommendation systems aptly demonstrates problems in relation to input and output data as well. To a certain degree at least, users of streaming services will consume what is suggested to them. This usage data is then fed back into the recommendation algorithms as input, which then serve up new but similar tracks as output. These tracks benefit from heavier rotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A feedback loop like this shows how algorithms can perpetuate or amplify prevailing inequalities in datasets. This becomes clear in the example of gender representation in music recommendations. 53\n",
      "\n",
      "## AI and sustainability\n",
      "\n",
      "Resource consumption among generative models is attracting increasing attention. For example, 700,000 litres of fresh water were used to train GPT3 in Microsoft data centres (by cooling systems and for the necessary power generation). 54\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of proposals have been submitted to counter this trend:\n",
      "\n",
      "- to improve current models instead of training new, proprietary ones\n",

      "\n",
      "This white paper has shed light on the multifaceted influences of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on the music industry. It has become clear that generative AI is far more than just a technological tool, rather a paradigm shift in music production, marketing and how it is experienced.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper also presented the core tenets of generative AI, from its technical fundamentals to specific use cases. It has made evident that generative AI in music production covers a range of different functions and areas of application, from experimental modelling tools to professional plug-ins and consumer/ creator tools. There is a broad range of potential applications for generative AI among music labels and publishers, from content creation to process optimisation. Although still at a nascent stage, the potential within the live segment is growing as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI may have capacity to turn music industry on its head. It offers fresh opportunities for creativity and personalisation, but presents the industry with complex challenges as well: the debate about copyright in AI-generated music and the ethical implications of distorted training data and cultural appropriation demonstrate that the roll-out of generative AI in the music industry requires careful and nuanced consideration. Evidently, it will be indispensable to ensure conscientious and sustainable use of AI in the music industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, it is reasonable to say that generative AI represents a technological as well as a cultural revolution. It challenges us to ponder the role of technology in creative work and demands a fresh mindset in regard to copyright, ethics and the relationship between humans and machines in art.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all the advances in technology, the focus must be placed on retaining human expression, creativity and emotion in music. Hence, generative AI must always be used to support and enhance - but never to replace - human creativity. The transformation brought about by generative AI should therefore take place in close collaboration with music creators. Their active participation is indispensable to ensuring the meaningful integration of AI into creative and marketing processes. This white paper is intended as our contribution to understanding and appraising this topic from a critical perspective.\n",
